# 500 - Schedule Weekly Calendar Events for This Week

In NotePad (https://app.noteplan.co or App or Desktop) choose **Weekly** from the Workspace "Industriousness".

Schedule your week's calendar events.

## 100 - Schedule a Task

To schedule a Task, see https://help.noteplan.co/article/110-how-to-schedule-tasks

For example, only schedule tasks that fall **within** this week (e.g. week 36, 1-7 September 2024).

In the Weekly (Week 36, 2024) enter the following tasks by copying and pasting the following text followed by <ENTER>:

```
09:00 - 10:00 Industriousness > 2024-09-02
09:00 - 10:00 Industriousness > 2024-09-03
09:00 - 10:00 Industriousness > 2024-09-04
09:00 - 10:00 Industriousness > 2024-09-05
09:00 - 10:00 Industriousness > 2024-09-06
```

**NOTE**: We skip the Sunday and Saturday, as "Industriousness" is an activity that is **not** planned for days other than weekdays (i.e. Monday - Friday).

- Now, in front of each line of text click on the **+** sign and choose **Task**.
- Also hit the < ENTER > key at the end of each line of text.

The above will automatically convert the text to a list of tasks called "Industriousness", planned for each workday of the week.

**TIP**: If you switch to Daily (e.g. 2 September 2024) and open the "# REFERENCE" section near the top, it will display:

```
**Week 36**
  O 09:00 - 10:00 Industriousness > 2024-09-02
```

## 200 - Close a Task if Completed

Checkmark the task "Industriousness" as completed for each day for which the task has finished.

## 300 - Update your Monthly, Quarterly and Yearly Periodic Notes

See [Where are the periodic notes](https://help.noteplan.co/article/180-where-are-the-periodic-notes-monthly-quarterly-and-yearly)

**TIP**: Enable and disable periodic notes inside Preferences > Calendar.
