# 600 - Manage Daily Calendar Events for Today

In NotePad (https://app.noteplan.co or App or Desktop) choose **Daily** from the Workspace "Industriousness".

Weekly tasks will show at the top of your Daily overview.

Manage your day by editing tasks and notes.

## 100 - Schedule a Task

To schedule a Task, see https://help.noteplan.co/article/110-how-to-schedule-tasks

For example, only schedule tasks that fall within this day (e.g. week 36, 2 September 2024).

In the Daily (Week 36, 2 September 2024) enter the following task by copying and pasting the following text:

```
09:00 - 09:10 Code a piece of software.
```

**NOTE**: Having a timeslot in front of the task is optional. However, only if a task is prefixed with a timeslot will it show in the calendar.

- Now, in front of the line of text click on the + sign and choose Task.
- Also hit the < ENTER > key at the end of the line of text.

The above will automatically convert the text to a task called "Code a piece of software.", planned for this day.

## 300 - Create a Checklist

See [How are checklists different from tasks?](https://help.noteplan.co/article/178-how-are-checklists-different-from-tasks)

Checklists are different from Tasks:

1) Checklists don't increment the overdue task counter on iOS Besdide the calendar title at the top.
2) Checklists don't appear in your Overdue list within Filters.
3) Checklists won't contribute to Calendar Heat Maps.

Checklists are best to be used for:

- Packing List (when traveling)
- Grocery Lists
- Goals
- Timeblocks
- Actual subtasks. You have one main task and a list of possible subtasks, ideas, etc.

Checklist are similar to Tasks:

1) Both Checklists and Tasks will show in calendars.
