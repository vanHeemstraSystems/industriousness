# 600 - Manage Daily Calendar Events for Today

In NotePad (https://app.noteplan.co or App or Desktop) choose **Daily** from the Workspace "Industriousness".

Weekly tasks will show at the top of your Daily overview.

Manage your day by editing tasks and notes.

## 100 - Schedule a Task

To schedule a Task, see https://help.noteplan.co/article/110-how-to-schedule-tasks

For example, only schedule tasks that fall within this day (e.g. week 36, 2 September 2024).

In the Daily (Week 36, 2 September 2024) enter the following task by copying and pasting the following text:

```
09:00 - 09:10 Code a piece of software.
```

**NOTE**: We skip the Sunday and Saturday, as "Industriousness" is an activity that is not planned for days other than weekdays (i.e. Monday - Friday).

**NOTE**: Having a timeslot in front of the task is optional. However, only if a task is prefixed with a timeslot, it will show in the calendar.

- Now, in front of the line of text click on the + sign and choose Task.
- Also hit the < ENTER > key at the end of the line of text.

The above will automatically convert the text to a task called "Code a piece of software.", planned for this day.
